Figure S1: Scree plot for indicating variance explained by each principal component (PC). Dashed vertical line represents expected variance explained if all components were equal, PCs with values over this line explain more than the average amount of variance.

Table 1 Variable loading scores within each of the selected principal components (PCs). 
<br>
Variable |                  PC-1	  PC-2	 PC-3 <br>
Leaf-Mass-per-Area (g/m2) |	0.657	  0.214  0.069 <br>
Water Content (%) |	        -0.643 -0.302 -0.003 <br>
Dry Biomass (g)	|           0.311	 -0.583  0.347 <br>
Anthocyanins (mg/gFW) |	    0.212	 -0.723	-0.258 <br>
Chlorophyll (mg/gFW)	|     0.112	  0.000	-0.899 <br>

Figure S2: Biplots for the combinations of the first three principal components (PC). A-C: Biplots with variable loadings. D-F: Biplots without variable loadings to show sample clustering by treatment. A and D) Biplots for PC1 vs PC2, B and E) Biplots for PC1 vs PC3, and C and F) Biplots for PC2 vs PC3
