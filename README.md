Figure S1: Summary plots for chlorophyll concentrations (mg/gFW) across treatments. A) Boxplot of chlorophyll concentration across treatments with points that indicate individual values. B) Barplot of average chlorophyll concentration across the treatments over the three sampling months. Lower case letters represent significant differences across groups, if at least one letter is shared there is no significant difference.

Figure S2: Scree plot for indicating variance explained by each principal component (PC). Dashed vertical line represents expected variance explained if all components were equal, PCs with values over this line explain more than the average amount of variance.

Leaf-Mass-per-Area (g/m2) |	0.657	  0.214  0.069 <br>
Water Content (%) |	        -0.643 -0.302 -0.003 <br>
Dry Biomass (g)	|           0.311	 -0.583  0.347 <br>
Anthocyanins (mg/gFW) |	    0.212	 -0.723	-0.258 <br>
Chlorophyll (mg/gFW)	|     0.112	  0.000	-0.899 <br>

Figure S3: Biplots for the combinations of the first three principal components (PC). A-C: Biplots with variable loadings. D-F: Biplots without variable loadings to show sample clustering by treatment. A and D) Biplots for PC1 vs PC2, B and E) Biplots for PC1 vs PC3, and C and F) Biplots for PC2 vs PC3
